# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is in early development. Only the latest commit on `main` is
supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues using GitHub Security Advisories. If that is not
available, open a new issue with the title prefixed by `SECURITY:` and include
only high-level details. We will follow up to arrange a private channel for
further discussion.

## Disclosure Process

We will acknowledge receipt of a report and work on a fix as quickly as we can.
We will coordinate disclosure with the reporter and publish a note in the
changelog when a fix is released.
